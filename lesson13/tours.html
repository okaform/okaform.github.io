           <h3>
             Conzumel Boat Tours
           </h3>
           <p>
            No trip to Cozumel is complete without a boat ride (or two) around the island's magnificently blue waters. 
            Whether you hop on board to scuba dive through some of Cozumel's magnificent reefs or to simply take in the 
            scenery during a sunset sail, most travelers agree that chartering a boat is worth the time and money.
           </p>
           <p>One of top traveler-approved tour operators is <a href="https://scubatony.com/">ScubaTony Cozumel</a>, which specializes in taking small 
             groups on scuba diving trips in the reefs around Cozumel. These start at $90 per person for a four-to 
             five-hour round-trip boat trip. The fee includes fresh fruit and drinks, along with marine park taxes and fees. 
             Rental gear costs extra. Recent visitors described their experiences with ScubaTony with words like 
             "perfect," "flawless" and "sublime." </p>

          <h3>
            Palancar Beach
          </h3>
          <p>
            Palancar Beach, one of the best all-around beach spots on Cozumel, is especially 
            acclaimed for its water sports, including kayaking, snorkeling, sailing and diving. 
            You can rent a dive charter and also grab some grub at the nearby restaurants and bars. 
            Travelers especially recommend Palancar Beach and Palancar Reef for cruise patrons 
            looking to escape a pre-planned excursion for a more authentic experience. 
          </p>
          <p>Travelers also described the just-offshore Palancar Gardens as an excellent
             spot for divers of all skill levels. Even if you're an experienced diver, 
             it's recommended you rent a charter to avoid the hassle of permits or licensing. 
             All diving companies must have a license to operate, and while swimmers are 
             allowed to dive on their own, we recommend that you hire local experts who 
             are familiar with the diving terrain. Others say it's a must-do even if 
             you're planning just to skim the surface snorkeling the Palancar Shallows.</p>

            Discover Mexico Park
          </h3>
          <p>
            Don't have the time to see all of Mexico's sites? 
            Just go to Discover Mexico Park. Sitting along the coast just south of 
            San Miguel, this park houses miniature models of some of the country's
             most popular attractions, including the Mayan ruins of Tulum and the 
             Metropolitan Cathedral of Mexico City. The park also provides insight 
             into Mexican culture, including a chocolate factory and the popular 
             tequila tasting exhibit. 
          </p>
          <p>Recent visitors said it's a great place if you're short on time,
             but still want to see and learn a lot about Mexico. Other travelers 
             attributed their great experience to the park's friendly and 
             knowledgeable tour guides, while others said the tequila tasting is not to be missed. </p>

            San Gervasio Ruins
          </h3>
          <p>
            Mayan women used to visit this shrine in central Cozumel to pay tribute to 
            their goddess of love and fertility, Ixchel. Today, you can pay a tribute of 
            your own by taking a brief tour of this ruin; it costs $9.50 to access the park.
             Most grumble about the cost of admission, but previous guests do recommend you 
             take some time to visit San Gervasio if you have never seen Mayan ruins up close. 
            Companies like Cozumel Tours will take you around and through the ruins, 
            but you could save time and a little expense by taking a taxi to the area 
            and walking through on your own.
